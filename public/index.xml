      <description>Responsive Nav Responsive navigation plugin without library dependencies and with fast touch screen support. Responsive Nav is a tiny JavaScript plugin which weighs only 1.3kb minified and Gzip’ed, and helps you to create a toggled navigation for small screens. It uses touch events and CSS3 transitions for the best possible performance. It also contains a “clever” workaround that makes it possible to transition from height: 0 to height: auto, which isn’t normally possible with CSS3 transitions.</description>

      <description>dimple Dimple is an object-oriented API allowing you to create flexible axis-based charts using d3.js.
The intention of this project is to allow analysts who are not necessarily expert JavaScript programmers to create standard (and some not-so-standard) business analytics.
The API will also expose the core d3 objects where possible so that as users gain confidence they can extend the base functionality in whatever way they wish.

      <description>Intense Images A stand alone javascript library for viewing images on the full, full screen. Using the touch/mouse position for panning. Here&amp;rsquo;s a demo! You can also play with the code live on CodePen.
Instructions Intense images is a stand alone library (no jquery, or the likes) so usage is pretty straight forward. All styling of image elements is up to the user, Intense.js only handles the creation, styling and management of the image viewer and captions.</description>

      <description>Introduction canvg is a SVG parser and renderer. It takes a URL to a SVG file or the text of an SVG file, parses it in JavaScript, and renders the result on a Canvas element. The rendering speed of the examples is about as fast as native SVG.
What&amp;rsquo;s implemented? The end goal is everything from the SVG spec. The majority of the rendering and animation is working. If you would like to see a feature implemented, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact me or add it to the issues list.</description>

      <description>Contributing If you’re looking for ways to contribute, please peruse open issues. The icebox is a good place to find ideas that are not currently in development. If you already have an idea, please check past issues to see whether your idea or a similar one was previously discussed.
Before submitting a pull request, consider implementing a live example first, say using bl.ocks.org. Real-world use cases go a long way to demonstrating the usefulness of a proposed feature.</description>

      <description>FlowType.JS Responsive web typography at its finest: font-size and line-height based on element width.
Check out the demo site.
What does FlowType.JS do? Ideally, the most legible typography contains between 45 and 75 characters per line. This is difficult to accomplish for all screen widths with only CSS media-queries. FlowType.JS eases this difficulty by changing the font-size and line-height based on a specific element&amp;rsquo;s width. This allows for a perfect character count per line at any screen width.</description>

      <description>This example shows how it is possible to use a D3 sunburst visualization (partition layout) with data that describes sequences of events.
A good use case is to summarize navigation paths through a web site, as in the sample synthetic data file (visit_sequences.csv). The visualization makes it easy to understand visits that start directly on a product page (e.g. after landing there from a search engine), compared to visits where users arrive on the site&amp;rsquo;s home page and navigate from there.</description>

      <description>biofabric a module for generating biofabric graphs using d3. adapted from this example and made more abstract
You will most likely have to do edits to the code to get your graph to render beautifully as the original code this was adapted from was designed around the miserables.json data.
usage var fabric = require(&#39;biofabric&#39;)fabric(graph, {width: 1400})graph should be a JS object like this:
{&amp;quot;nodes&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;group&amp;quot;:1},{&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;group&amp;quot;:2}],&amp;quot;links&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;source&amp;quot;:1,&amp;quot;target&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;:1}]}</description>

      <description>Railroad-diagram Generator This is a small js library for generating railroad diagrams (like what JSON.org uses) using SVG.
Railroad diagrams are a way of visually representing a grammar in a form that is more readable than using regular expressions or BNF. I think (though I haven&amp;rsquo;t given it a lot of thought yet) that if it&amp;rsquo;s easy to write a context-free grammar for the language, the corresponding railroad diagram will be easy as well.</description>

      <description>d3-legend Full documentation: http://d3-legend.susielu.com
Usage Using just the minified file You must inclue the d3 library before including the legend file. Then you can simply add the compiled js file to your website:
d3-legend.min.js d3-legend.js (Human readable version) Using CDN You can also add latest version of d3-legend hosted on cdnjs.
Using npm Already using d3? Great! You can add the d3 legend as a node module by running:
npm i d3-svg-legend -S</description>

      <description>htmlwidgets in effect are reusable HTML/JS/CSS components (think simple Polymer or WebComponents). I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it, but if we wanted to use an htmlwidget with no R, it is fairly straightforward. Even if you decided not to do this, I think it will be helpful in your journey to htmlwidgets mastery.
We&amp;rsquo;ll use the simple but powerful jsonedit from the listviewer package. Its JavaScript binding is very sparse, so I hope it will be a good subject.</description>
