# Hugo Lithium

A simple responsive blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) forked from https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme with modifications to make it work better with [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).

The easiest way to get started is to create a new (empty) RStudio project, then

```r
devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')  # install blogdown
blogdown::new_site(theme = 'yihui/hugo-lithium')
```

Then you should be able to see an example website launched in the RStudio Viewer.

For the full documentation, please see this section in the **blogdown** book: https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/themes.html

## Features

- Blog
- Responsive
- Disqus
- Google Analytics
- Google web fonts (Merriweather and Lato)
- MathJax
- highlight.js

## Changes

The main changes I made to the original hugo-lithium-theme are:

1. Added support for [MathJax](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html) (for rendering LaTeX math expressions) and highlight.js (for syntax highlighting).

    - For both libraries, you can specify the CDN host (e.g., CloudFlare, BootCDN, ...).

    - For highlight.js, you can specify additional languages (e.g., `r`, `yaml`, `tex`, ...).

1. Added Google web fonts (embedded in the theme so that visitors from countries where Google is banned can still see the typefaces).

1. Improved Hugo's built-in Disqus template, so that you can actually view the comments even when you are previewing the website locally.

1. Replaced the variable `.Permalink` with `.RelPermalink`, and function `absURL` with `relURL` where necessary. It is a bad idea to use full absolute links (with the protocol and domain) in general. For example, `.Permalink` and `absURL` may generate URLs of the form `http://www.example.com/foo/bar.html`, but `/foo/bar.html` is more portable.
