After Jenny Bryan's fantastic PlotCon presentation [Data Rectangling](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/data-rectangling), I started thinking what would a `d3.js` hierarchy look like as a nested `tibble`.


## d3r Shows Us

I had forgotten that in `d3r::d3_nest` I provided an argument to get the `tibble` instead of the JSON, so getting an example on your machine should be fairly simple (let me know if it isn't).  We will use the helpful `random.hierarchical.data` function in the `treemap` package to generate the data.

```{r}
# install.packages("d3r")
# install.packages("treemap")
library(treemap)
library(d3r)

d3_nest(
  random.hierarchical.data(),
  json = FALSE
)[,c("id","children")]
```

## Still No Easier to Query

Unfortunately, even though we can get the data in this form, I don't think R tooling makes it any easier to query or manipulate.  Please let me know if you have ideas or a workflow for working with this type data in R.  [`data.tree`](https://github.com/gluc/data.tree) seems to be our best option.
