Why DownloadJS?
---------------

- Avoids stupid blank screens after file starts downloading in Chrome, Safari;
- Ignores content type by using virtual link with "download" attribute. So file will be downloaded even if content type says browser to show file`s content in new window. This allows to download PNGs, HTMLs and so on;
- Small function without any dependencies.
- Informs user if downloading is restricted on his device avoiding unpredicted behaviour.
