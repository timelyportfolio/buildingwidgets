## htmlwidgets News This Week
-[\@hrbrmstr](https://github.com/hrbrmstr) - d3 streamgraph layout [`streamgraph`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/streamgraph).  Bob Rudis builds on his list of authored widgets with this very nice `htmlwidget` for streamgraphs.  See the [announcement](http://hrbrmstr.github.io/streamgraph/) for a through discussion.

-[\@smartinsightsfromdata](https://github.com/smartinsightsfromdata) - [`rpivotTable`](https://github.com/smartinsightsfromdata/rpivotTable) provides a `htmlwidget` for the very well done [PivotTable.js](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/) by [Nicholas Krutchen](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/).  Not only will Excel users feel more at home now, but also there are lots of very interesting views, such as treemaps and heatmaps.  If you still like old-fashioned `tables` and their derivatives in R like I do, please let me know, and maybe we can convince the author to add the couple lines to support these very handy and far-from-obsolete beauties.


## This Week's Widget - `rbokeh` | bokeh for R

Python and even Scala and Julia have [`Bokeh`](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/), so R should too.  Fortunately, [Ryan Hafen](https://twitter.com/hafenstats) from Purdue and [Tessara](http://tessera.io/) has been applying his very thorough R skills to make [`rbokeh`](http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh), a professionally built `htmlwidget` for `Bokeh`.  Just look at that site and the documentation, and I think you'll quickly get as excited as I am for the potential of `rbokeh`.

I should **note that Ryan deserves all the credit for `rbokeh`**.  I simply chipped in with some additional examples, testing, lots of questions, and minor pull requests.  I hope I can also help implement a bar chart and full seamless shiny integration.  Feel free to contribute any way you can.  Every little bit helps.

## Examples

I understand how hard it is to motivate R users spoiled by `ggplot2`, `lattice`, and even base `graphics`.  Borrowing from these great libraries, Ryan has integrated many good bits into `rbokeh`.  Enough writing, let's see some examples.  You'll notice `rbokeh` loves modern R pipes.

```{r "example01", eval = F}
# devtools::install("hafen/rbokeh")

library(rbokeh)
# basic pipes built in but I love pipeR
library(pipeR)

# diamonds is always my goto for kind of big data
data(diamonds, package="ggplot2")

figure( width = 600, height = 600, title = "Diamonds from ggplot2" ) %>>%
  ly_hexbin(
    carat
    ,log(price)
    ,data = diamonds
  )
```


```{r "example01_run", echo = F}
# devtools::install("hafen/rbokeh")

library(rbokeh)
# basic pipes built in but I love pipeR
library(pipeR)

# diamonds is always my goto for kind of big data
data(diamonds, package="ggplot2")

figure( width = 600, height = 600, title = "Diamonds from ggplot2" ) %>>%
  ly_hexbin(
    carat
    ,log(price)
    ,data = diamonds
  ) %>>%
  (
   htmlwidgets::as.iframe(
      rbokeh:::plot.BokehFigure(.)
      ,file="example01.html"
      , libdir = "lib"
      , selfcontained=F
      , width = 750
      , height = 750
      , overflow = "hidden"
   ))
```

`Bokeh` renders to canvas, so it can handle lots of points.

```{r "example02", eval = F}
figure( width = 600, height = 400, title = "Diamonds from ggplot2" ) %>>%
  ly_points(
    x = carat
    , y = price
    , data = diamonds
    , color = color
    , size = 2
  )
```

```{r "example02_run", echo = F}
figure( width = 600, height = 400, title = "Diamonds from ggplot2" ) %>>%
  ly_points(
    x = carat
    , y = price
    , data = diamonds
    , color = color
    , size = 2
  ) %>>%
  (
   htmlwidgets::as.iframe(
      rbokeh:::plot.BokehFigure(.)
      ,file="example02.html"
      , libdir = "lib"
      , selfcontained=F
      , width = 750
      , height = 550
      , overflow = "hidden"
   ))
```

`lm` plugs right into `rbokeh`.

```{r "example03", eval = F}
figure( width = 700, height = 400, title = "Diamonds lm with rbokeh" ) %>>%
  ly_points(
    x = carat
    , y = price
    , data = diamonds
    , color = color
    , size = 2
  ) %>>%
  ly_abline(
    lm( price ~ carat, diamonds )
    ,type = 2
    ,width = 3
  )
```
```{r "example03_run", echo = F}
figure( width = 600, height = 400, title = "Diamonds lm with rbokeh" ) %>>%
  ly_points(
    x = carat
    , y = price
    , data = diamonds
    , color = color
    , size = 2
  ) %>>%
  ly_abline(
    lm( price ~ carat, diamonds )
    ,type = 2
    ,width = 3
  ) %>>%
  (
   htmlwidgets::as.iframe(
      rbokeh:::plot.BokehFigure(.)
      ,file="example03.html"
      , libdir = "lib"
      , selfcontained=F
      , width = 750
      , height = 550
      , overflow = "hidden"
   ))
```

Now would be a great time to show `facets` with `rbokeh`.  `grid_plot` gives us a way to achieve these, but `facets` require a little extra effort.  But hey, we all need to know `*apply` anyways.  Let's split the plot above by clarity.

```{r "example04", eval = F}
lapply(
  levels(diamonds$clarity)
  ,function(clar){
    figure( width = 300, height = 300, title = paste0("Clarity: ",clar )) %>>%
      ly_points(
        x = carat
        , y = price
        , data = subset(diamonds,clarity==clar)
        , color = color
        , size = 2
      ) %>>%
      ly_abline(
        lm( price ~ carat, subset(diamonds,clarity==clar) )
        ,type = 2
        ,width = 3
      )    
  }
) %>>%
  ( grid_plot( ., nrow = 2, ncol = 4, same_axes = T ) )
```
```{r "example04_run", echo = F}
lapply(
  levels(diamonds$clarity)
  ,function(clar){
    figure( width = 300, height = 300, title = paste0("Clarity: ",clar )) %>>%
      ly_points(
        x = carat
        , y = price
        , data = subset(diamonds,clarity==clar)
        , color = color
        , size = 2
      ) %>>%
      ly_abline(
        lm( price ~ carat, subset(diamonds,clarity==clar) )
        ,type = 2
        ,width = 3
      )    
  }
) %>>%
  ( grid_plot( ., nrow = 2, ncol = 4, same_axes = T ) ) %>>%
  (
   htmlwidgets::as.iframe(
      rbokeh:::plot.BokehGridPlot(.)
      ,file="example04.html"
      , libdir = "lib"
      , selfcontained=F
      , width = 750
      , height = 750
      , overflow = "hidden"
   ))
```

I hope this along with Ryan's site and documentation will be enough for you to get excited and get started.  It is an amazing package with immense functionality.  Just look at this [periodic table](http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/#htmlwidget-6405) and this [baseball hexbin](http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/#htmlwidget-427).

### Examples from `ggplot2` & `lattice` books
`rbokeh` can do so much that I could write an entire book.  I have started by replicating many of the examples from `ggplot2` and `lattice` books in this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/timelyportfolio/8300c43ac43d772600df).


## Thanks
