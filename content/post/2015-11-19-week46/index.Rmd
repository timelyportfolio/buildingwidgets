## This Week's Widget - colaR

[Tim Dwyer](http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/~dwyer/) makes really great stuff.  As one recent example, see [this video](https://vimeo.com/groups/vis2015previews/videos/136205841) preview of HOLA: Human-like Orthogonal Network Layout which won Best Infovis Paper at [VIS 2015](http://ieeevis.org/year/2015/info/overview-amp-topics/papers-sessions).  Unfortunately though, Dwyer does not make his great stuff in `R`.  This is where what I call super-isomorphism with `htmlwidgets` and Jeroen Ooms' [`V8`](https://github.com/jeroenooms/V8) becomes very handy.  We can get all the benefit of something like Dwyer's [WebCola](http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/webcola/) without the need to rewrite or port code.

I hesitate to call this week's [`colaR`](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/colaR) an `htmlwidget`, since I only use the htmlwidget infrastructure currently to provide the JavaScript dependencies for `HTML` or `V8`.  I can't help dedicating this week to this amazing JavaScript.  I hope someone smarter, more creative, and/or more diligent can take this and run with it.  Of all the `htmlwidgets`, this is one I really, really hope someone pushes to its full potential.

## Installation

This is not on CRAN, so to install we will need some help from `devtools::install_github`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/colaR")
```

## Examples

We'll explore some super-isomorphism.  First, let's recreate the [gridified small group example](http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/webcola/examples/gridifiedSmallGroups.html) with `igraph` and `V8` + `colaR`.  I'll try to get as close as possible to the final output minus the interactivity of course.

### igraph and V8

```{r "example01"}
# devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/colaR")
# demo how we can use WebCola in R with V8

library(V8)
library(jsonlite)
library(igraph)
library(scales)
library(pipeR)

ctx = new_context(global="window")

ctx$source(system.file("htmlwidgets/lib/WebCola/cola.js",package = "colaR"))

### small grouped example
group_json <- fromJSON(
  system.file(
    "htmlwidgets/lib/WebCola/examples/graphdata/smallgrouped.json",
    package = "colaR"
  )
)

# need to get forEach polyfill
ctx$source(
  "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es5-shim/4.1.10/es5-shim.min.js"
)

# code to recreate small group example
js_group <- '
// console.assert does not exists
console = {}
console.assert = function(){};

var width = 960,
    height = 500

graph = {
    "nodes":[
{"name":"a","width":60,"height":40},
{"name":"b","width":60,"height":40},

{"name":"g","width":60,"height":40}

"links":[
{"source":1,"target":2},
{"source":2,"target":3},
{"source":3,"target":4},
{"source":0,"target":1},

"groups":[

]
}

var g_cola = new cola.Layout()
    .linkDistance(100)
    .avoidOverlaps(true)
    .handleDisconnected(false)
    .size([width, height]);

g_cola
    .nodes(graph.nodes)
    .links(graph.links)
    .groups(graph.groups)
    .start()

'

# run the small group JS code in V8
ctx$eval(js_group)

# make an igraph from the graph JSON
igf <- graph.data.frame(
  group_json$links + 1
  ,vertices =  data.frame(id = 1:nrow(group_json$nodes),group_json$nodes)
)

# use WebCola in V8 to layout the graph
igf_layout <- ctx$get('
  graph.nodes.map(function(d){
    return [d.x,-d.y]
  })                    
')

# plot the small group as much like the example as possible
# start with an empty plot
plot.new()
# set our x and y scale limits
plot.window(xlim=c(-3,3),ylim=c(-1,1))


ctx$get('graph.groups.map(function(d){return d.bounds})') %>>%
  (
    rect(
      xleft = rescale(.$x, c(-1,1), from = range(igf_layout[,1]))
      ,ybottom = rescale(-.$Y, c(-1,1), range(igf_layout[,2]))
      ,xright = rescale(.$X, c(-1,1), from = range(igf_layout[,1]))
      ,ytop = rescale(-.$y, c(-1,1), range(igf_layout[,2]))
      ,col = c(
        rgb(31/255, 119/255, 180/255,alpha=0.7)

      )
      ,border = NA
    )
  )

plot(
  igf
  , layout = igf_layout
  , vertex.shape = "square"
  , vertex.label.color = "white"
  , vertex.color = rgb(255, 187, 120, maxColorValue = 255)
  , vertex.frame.color = "white"
  , vertex.size = 25
  , edge.arrow.mode = "-"
  , edge.color = "#7A4E4E"
  , edge.width= 2
  #, mark.groups = lapply(group_json$groups$leaves,function(x)x+1)
  , add = TRUE
)

```


### htmltools

Now let's use `htmltools` to recreate the [alignment constraints example](http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/webcola/examples/alignment.html) exactly with full interactivity.  Note, I deserve no credit for this code.  I'll include the condensed version below.  Please see [htmltools_alignment_example.R](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/colaR/blob/master/inst/examples/htmltools_aligment_example.R) for the full source.

```{r "example_02", eval = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/colaR")
library(htmltools)
library(colaR)

# almost all code copied/pasted from
#   WebCola example
#   https://github.com/tgdwyer/WebCola/blob/master/WebCola/examples/alignment.html
#   http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/webcola/examples/alignment.html
#  make our alignment page
browsable(tagList(
  tags$html(
    tags$head(
      webcola_alignment_style()
    ),
    tags$h1("Alignment constraints with guidelines"),
    webcola_alignment_script(),
    tags$p("Nodes 'a', 'b' and 'e' are constrained to the same y-coordinate.  'b', 'c' and 'd' are constrained to the same x.")
  ),
  # add d3 and WebCola
  d3(),
  cola()
))
```
