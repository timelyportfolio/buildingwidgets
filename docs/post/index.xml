      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;break from unpaid open sourcebreak from unpaid open sourceDecember 09, 2016MotivationsConclusionToday I start my day differently. I start my day writing this very difficult post instead of open source code. For 2017, I plan to take a break from all unpaid open source contributions. Saying all this is especially difficult knowing that there are others out there, namely CRAN team and Mike Bostock who do far more than I.</description>

      <title>d3 Hierarchy as Nested Tibble</title>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;d3 hierarchy as nested tibbled3 hierarchy as nested tibbleNovember 28, 2016d3r Shows UsStill No Easier to QueryAfter Jenny Bryan’s fantastic PlotCon presentation Data Rectangling, I started thinking what would a d3.js hierarchy look like as a nested tibble.
d3r Shows UsI had forgotten that in d3r::d3_nest I provided an argument to get the tibble instead of the JSON, so getting an example on your machine should be fairly simple (let me know if it isn’t).</description>

      <title>Look Ma No R</title>
      <link>/2016/08/04/widgets-without-r/</link>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;htmlwidgets in effect are reusable HTML/JS/CSS components (think simple Polymer or WebComponents) I don’t recommend it, but if we wanted to use an htmlwidget with no R, it is fairly straightforward. Even if you decided not to do this, I think it will be helpful in your journey to htmlwidgets mastery.
We’ll use the simple but powerful jsonedit from the listviewer package. Its JavaScript binding is very sparse, so I hope it will be a good subject.</description>

I think it has all sorts of helpful uses in R, so functionplotR will be this week’s htmlwidget. Note, I released a couple days early.</description>

As one recent example, see this video preview of HOLA: Human-like Orthogonal Network Layout which won Best Infovis Paper at VIS 2015. Unfortunately though, Dwyer does not make his great stuff in R. This is where what I call super-isomorphism with htmlwidgets and Jeroen Ooms’ V8 becomes very handy.</description>

This Week’s Widget - shotsignRPeter Beshai created beautiful d3.js Shooting Signatures to visualize basketball shooting performance. It was definitely love at first sight for me.</description>

Of course, we need an emoji htmlwidget. Since remoji already brings some emoji power to R, I thought I would try to piggyback on it and reduce the future number of R packages by at least 1.</description>

At the beginning of the week, I started banging away on a htmlwidget extension to networkD3 using Elijah Meeks’ d3.layout.adjacencyMatrix. The deeper I got the more I realized that an adjacency matrix really is just a subset of a heatmap, so then I started replicating Matthew Lincoln’s fine Shiny/ggplot2 adjacency matrix with RStudio/Joe Cheng’s d3heatmap.</description>

Last week networkD3 hit CRAN with version 0.2.4, so I’ll claim networkD3 as the htmlwidget of the week.</description>

This swimlane timeline layout fills a void for both the JavaScript and R world, so I thought let’s make an htmlwidget with it. I very creatively call it timelineR.</description>

While ggparallel does a very nice job, this ridiculously amazing interactive d3.js parallel sets implementation by Jason Davies needs a htmlwidget. When a JavaScript library is as well designed as d3-parsets, wrapping it as an htmlwidget can be very quick and straightforward.</description>

Yaron Noveh’s absolutely amazing gifw00t lets us record GIFs in the browser client-side, so if I wrap it in a htmlwidget I can record GIFs of my RStudio Viewer or Shiny session and share them with the world.</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;Week 22 - Introductory Use of d3vennRIntroductory Use of d3vennRKent Russell2015-06-05Venn diagrams are certainly not perfect. However, if you understand their limitations, Venn (Euler) diagrams can provide a useful way to provide context and overview. venn.js from Ben Frederickson makes creating Venn diagrams easy by doing the math to layout the sets and leveraging d3.js for rendering and interactivity.
Installd3vennR is not on CRAN and probably never will be unless someone asks me to submit, so please use devtools::install_github() to install.</description>

Since then, DiagrammeR’s author Rich Iannone has amazed me with his efforts to improve, grow, and document (truly something special) the package. DiagrammeR began with mermaid(mermaid.js) and then quickly added grViz(viz.js/graphviz) as two methods to both layout and render diagrams specified as text.</description>
