<h2>htmlwidgets News This Week</h2>
<p><code>htmlwidgets</code> are getting so popular that it is very difficult to keep up with them. Hopefully, we’ll soon have a gallery of built and in-process <code>htmlwidgets</code>, since it now seems beyond my ability to keep up with all the developments. I’ll give away one little hint for those who want to be on the cutting edge. Just do this <a href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&amp;p=35&amp;q=htmlwidgets&amp;s=indexed&amp;type=Code">Github search</a>, and you’ll likely see all the newest and latest.</p>
<div id="htmlwidgets-iteration" class="section level3">
<h3><code>htmlwidgets</code> Iteration</h3>
<p>I have noticed some interesting things being done over at <a href="http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR">DiagrammeR</a> with <code>exportSVG</code>, <a href="https://github.com/kwbroman/qtlcharts">qtlcharts</a>, and <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/DT/shiny.html">DT</a> with some revolutionary Shiny integration.</p>
</div>
<div id="videos" class="section level3">
<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>So far, videos on <code>htmlwidgets</code> have been limited, but that changed this week with three new videos from very credible sources (except for one).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>rOpenSci <a href="https://vimeo.com/121720465">call</a> with Ramnath Vaidyanathan</li>
<li>RStudio <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/">webinar</a> on <code>htmlwidgets</code> with Yihui Xie</li>
<li>useR Birmigham, Alabama <a href="https://youtu.be/b8PClzD-CXE">Presentation</a> by me</li>

<h2>This Week’s Widget - <code>navr</code> | Responsive Toolbars and Nav</h2>
<p><a href="http://responsive-nav.com"><code>Responsive-Nav</code></a> is a delightfully tiny and dependency-free JavaScript library for reponsive nav toolbars. Much like last’s week widget <code>sortableR</code>, this week’s widget should fit in nicely nearly anywhere. The only reason you might choose not to use would be if you have decided to include the much heavier Bootstrap. Otherwise, this little powerhouse can serve you in all sorts of helpful and pretty ways.</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p><code>navr</code> has not achieved CRAN status yet, so for now we will install with <code>devtools::install_github</code> as shown in the code below.</p>

<h3><code>htmlwidget</code> Example</h3>
<p>I can imagine a scenario where one of our <code>htmlwidget</code> friends might need a toolbar. Let’s say a <code>DiagrammeR</code> diagram wants to add a toolbar for exporting the rendered SVG. We could do something like this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DiagrammeR)

gV &lt;- grViz(
  &quot;digraph{ DiagrammeR -&gt; HTML; navr -&gt; HTML; HTML -&gt; beautiful; }&quot;
  , height = 300, width = 600
)

tagList(
  # wrap diagram in a div since a lot of htmlwidgets clear contents
  tags$div(id = &quot;diagram-needs-toolbar&quot;
    ,gV
  )
  ,navr(
    selector = &quot;#diagram-needs-toolbar&quot;
    # use HTML instead of tags
    ,taglist = HTML(&quot;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a onclick = 'exportSVG()' href = '#diagram-needs-toolbar'&gt;Export to SVG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &quot;
    )
  )
  ,tags$script(&quot;
    function exportSVG(){
      window.open(
        [
          'data:;base64,',
          window.btoa((new XMLSerializer()).serializeToString(
              document.getElementById('diagram-needs-toolbar')
                .getElementsByTagName('svg')[0]
          ))
        ].join('')
      )
    }

<h3>Stylish Hover Effects</h3>
<p>We can apply these stylish <a href="http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/">hover effects</a> from <a href="https://github.com/IanLunn">Ian Lunn</a> with the helper function <code>add_hover</code>. There are lots of different effects. Let’s try <code>pop</code> and <code>float</code>.</p>

    ,&quot;Hover effects are nice and let our users know that our
      navr actually does something.  Just wait until you see our navr with icons.&quot;

<h3>Awesome Font-Awesome Icons</h3>
<p>Font-Awesome are the nice open-source MIT-licensed icons in Bootstrap. <code>add_font</code> makes it easy to use these icons in our toolbar. Even neater, the hover effects shown below play very nicely with Font-Awesome, so I would encourage <code>add_hover</code> + <code>add_font_awesome</code>. <em>If you’re in shiny, no need to use <code>add_font_awesome</code> since Bootstrap already gives you these icons.</em></p>
