### dimple ###

Dimple is an object-oriented API allowing you to create flexible axis-based charts using [d3.js](http://d3js.org "d3.js").

The intention of this project is to allow analysts who are not necessarily expert JavaScript programmers to create standard (and some not-so-standard) business analytics.

The API will also expose the core d3 objects where possible so that as users gain confidence they can extend the base functionality in whatever way they wish.

Please visit the main website [dimplejs.org](http://dimplejs.org "dimple.js") for more information and examples.
