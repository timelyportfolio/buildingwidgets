<h2>This Week’s Widget - <code>rcdimple</code> | rCharts dimple</h2>
<p>I fell in love with <a href="http://dimplejs.org">dimple</a> the moment I saw it (not long after its May 21, 2013 initial commit). So, way, way back on June 19, 2013 I added dimple to <code>rCharts</code> in this <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv/rCharts/commit/408bebc60eb2649baea16c73ce40fd444bcf0acb">commit</a>. Since then, my love for dimple is as strong as the day of first sight. I think some folks know, but Ramnath Vaidyanathan has big plans for an <code>htmlwidgets</code> version of <code>rCharts</code> called <code>rCharts2</code>. I just couldn’t wait any longer to make this little <code>rcdimple</code> part public.</p>
<p>For those who might not like my implementation of dimple, please see this other version <a href="https://github.com/jpmarindiaz/dimpler"><code>dimpler</code></a> and also let me know what part you don’t like about <code>rcdimple</code>.</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p><code>rcdimple</code> has not achieved CRAN status yet, so for now we will install with <code>devtools::install_github</code> as shown in the code below. Lots and lots of demos are in the package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;timelyportfolio/rcdimple&quot;)
library(rcdimple)
demo(dimple)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="vignette-examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Vignette Examples</h2>
<p>Every package needs a vignette, so I will make this the first <code>rcdimple</code> vignette.</p>
<div id="introduction-to-rcdimple" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction to <code>rcdimple</code></h3>
<p><code>rcdimple</code> is an <code>htmlwidget</code> that leverages the upcoming common methods and conventions of <code>rCharts2</code> to make interactive plotting easy and consistent. Many of these ideas evolve from lessons learned with the <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv/rCharts"><code>rCharts</code></a> package from <a href="https://github.com/ramnathv">Ramnath Vaidyanathan</a> who also authored much of the <code>htmlwidgets</code> package. Also, you might notice some bits and pieces of goodness from <code>lattice</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, and base <code>graphics</code>. For a nearly complete set of examples from the <a href="http://dimplejs.org/examples_index.html">dimple examples</a>, do <code>demo(dimple)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples-with-r-graph-catalog" class="section level3">
<h3>Examples with r-graph-catalog</h3>
<p>As a quick introduction to <code>rcdimple</code>, let’s use <code>rcdimple</code> to make some of the plots from <a href="http://shinyapps.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/">r-graph-catalog</a> by Joanna Zhao and <a href="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/">Jennifer Bryan</a> which recreates most of the plots in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Effective-Graphs-Naomi-Robbins/dp/0985911123">“Creating More Effective Graphs”</a> by <a href="http://www.nbr-graphs.com/">Naomi Robbins</a>. Yes, this is a reproduction of a reproduction, but it should be insightful. We’ll concentrate on those graphs tagged as “good graphs”, and if successful lines of code to create these interactive versions will be &lt;= lines of code to make the <code>ggplot2</code> versions.</p>
